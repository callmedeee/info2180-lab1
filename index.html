 <p>Bonjour! with just that greeting you can guess that I like French. 
	I am a Computer Science Major at The University of the West Indies. 
	I like the colour Pink. Travelling to Paris is on my future bucket list. 
	I love food. I'm an introvert and I enjoy reading in my spare time. I am interested in Web Development because it is fun. The skillset learnt will help in the creation websites for my own business</p>
